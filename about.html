                    <h2 class="is-3">Software developer</h2>
                    <p>Sbusiso started his career as the first intern at Imagin8, a company based in Johannesburg.</p>
                    <p>Upon graduating he received a position as a junior software developer at the company where he
                        worked on internal and client software solutions providing his technical expetise to multiple
                        <abbr title="Small and medium enterprises">SMEs</abbr>
                        .</p>
                    <p>Sbu's passion for software is what fuels him and keeps him on top of the game, on a typical
                        day you would find him learning technologies or concepts and sharing his knowledge with
                        those around him. He also has a couple of apps of his own that he works on to keep his
                        skills up to date.</p>

                    <p>When he is not writing code or reading books about programming Sbu is usually on his Wacom
                        Intuos sketching up a storm.
                        He has worked on a couple of pieces he will put up online soon.

                    <h2 class="is-3">Investor</h2>
                    <p>Sbu started the journey to financial freedom after being inspired by his sister who had saved
                        up tens of thousands from her allowance right in front of his eyes.</p>
                    <p>The push came after he read How to Create, Manage, Fix and Grow your Business a book written
                        by Adam Rabinowitz, the CEO of Imagin8. After reading the book he decided to start saving up
                        money and set up his financial ducks in a row.</p>
                    <p>After receiving his 13th checque he went into a CNA looking for a playstation but came out
                        with a bag of books including Sam BeckBessinger's Manage your money like a F*cking grown up.
                        That's when the journey started</p>
                    <p>Since then he has been setting up budgets, adding a software development twist into
                        it by developing applications such as an expense tracker and a stock portfolio manager which
                        you can find on his <a href="https://github.com/SbusisoMabena">Github</a></p>
